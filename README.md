# User-search
# 🔎 User Search App

A simple React-based search application that allows users to search for people by **first name** or **last name**.  
The app uses a JSON dataset as source and displays results in a responsive card layout.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Search by First & Last Name**  
  Type in the search box and press **Enter** to filter results.  
  The app matches case-insensitively against both first and last names.

- **Responsive UI**  
  Built with **Tailwind CSS**, optimized for desktop and mobile views.

- **Dynamic Search Results**  
  - Matching results are displayed in a card grid.  
  - If no results are found, a placeholder image and message are shown.

- **Navigation Behavior**  
  - Pressing **Enter** triggers filtering without page reload.  
  - If the site is **refreshed**, it redirects back to the home page and clears the search box.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/vitejs/plugin-react-swc/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
